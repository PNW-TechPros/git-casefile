In an asynchronous code execution environment, use of immutable data containers — such as those provided by [the `immutable` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/immutable) — can simplify planning and reasoning about the code's behavior.  Lenses and efficiently immutable data structures work together synergistically, yet not every application of lenses needs or wants the [immutable]{@link external:immutable} package installed.  To avoid introducing a dependency between this library and the [immutable]{@link external:immutable} package, `natural-lenses` limits its importing from [immutable]{@link external:immutable} to one dangling submodule.  [`natural-lenses/immutable`]{@link module:natural-lenses/immutable} exports two objects, of which the [`lensFactory`]{@link module:natural-lenses/immutable#lensFactory} is the more convenient: it is a {@link Factory} customized with a container factory building [`immutable.List`s]{@link external:immutable.List} and [`immutable.Map`s]{@link external:immutable.Map}.  That container factory is the other export, under the name `containerFactory`, which can be used in constructing a {@link Factory}.

The [`natural-lenses/immutable`]{@link module:natural-lenses/immutable} submodule also has a side-effect of polyfilling support for lenses into [immutable]{@link external:immutable} types.  Though [`immutable.List`]{@link external:immutable.List}, [`immutable.Map`]{@link external:immutable.Map}, and [`immutable.OrderedMap`]{@link external:immutable.OrderedMap} classes share many interface semantics with ES6 container types, they are not identical and two specific behaviors have to be defined for the container types to work with lenses (both named by `Symbol`s): [`lens.at_maybe`]{@link module:natural-lenses#at_maybe} and [`lens.clone`]{@link module:natural-lenses#at_maybe}.  The first implements the behavior for returning a Maybe monad value for the given key/index, and the second implements cloning with potential modifications of `set` or `spliceOut`.  Because the methods are named with `Symbol`s defined by this package, this polyfill should not interfere with application code or any other libraries in use.

Importing [`natural-lenses/immutable`]{@link module:natural-lenses/immutable} also has the side-effect of polyfilling {@link Optic} with a [`getSeq`]{@link ImmutableLensMixin~getSeq} method that constructs a `Seq` (from the `immutable` package) from the non-string iterable in the {@link Optic}'s target slot (or from an empty array if the slot's contents are a string or not iterable).

Even if no modified clones are to be created, the [`lens.at_maybe`]{@link module:natural-lenses#at_maybe} must be defined for immutable container types to participate in lens *getting*, so it may be beneficial to run [`lens.polyfillImmutable`]{@link module:natural-lenses#polyfillImmutable} on all [`immutable`]{@link external:immutable} types that might be present in data to be queried with lenses.

Because this library _does not_ declare a dependency on `immutable`, it is the responsibility of the including project to declare it's own dependency on both that package and this one if both are to be used.
